# Example Code

## How TensorFlow.js is Used in the Example

In the provided HTML code, TensorFlow.js is used to build, train, and run a machine learning model in the browser to predict which customers are most likely to make future purchases based on their data. Here's how it fits into the customer targeting application:

1. **Purpose**:
   - The model takes customer data (age, total purchases, purchase frequency, average purchase, income, purchase type, and distance from store) and predicts a "target score" (0 to 1) indicating the likelihood of future purchases.
   - The scores are used to rank existing customers and predict a score for a new customer entered via a form.

2. **Key Components**:
   - **Data Preparation**: Customer data is normalized (scaled to 0–1) to make it easier for the model to process.
   - **Model Creation**: A neural network is built to learn patterns from the data.
   - **Training**: The model learns from the customer data and synthetic target scores.
   - **Prediction**: The trained model predicts scores for both existing customers (to rank them) and new customers (via the form).
   - **Display**: Results are shown in a table for ranked customers and below the form for new customer predictions, with an explanation of the score.

3. **TensorFlow.js Role**:
   - TensorFlow.js is a JavaScript library that allows machine learning in the browser. It handles all the math and computations needed to build, train, and run the neural network without requiring a server.
   - In the code, it’s loaded via a CDN: `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs@3.21.0/dist/tf.min.js"></script>`.

### How TensorFlow.js Works in the Example (Step-by-Step)

Let’s break down how TensorFlow.js operates in the code, using simple language:

#### 1. **Loading Data**
   - The code starts with a JSON array (`salesData`) containing customer details, like:
     ```javascript
     { id: 1, name: "Alice Smith", age: 25, totalPurchases: 1500, purchaseFrequency: 12, avgPurchase: 125, income: 40000, purchaseType: 1, distanceFromStore: 5 }
     ```
   - TensorFlow.js doesn’t directly use this raw data. Instead, the code prepares it by:
     - **Normalizing Features**: Converting numbers (e.g., age, purchases) to a 0–1 scale so they’re comparable. For example, an age of 25 is normalized between the minimum (19) and maximum (60) ages in the dataset.
     - **Adjusting Frequency**: Reducing `purchaseFrequency` based on `distanceFromStore` (e.g., `adjustedFrequency = purchaseFrequency * (1 - distanceFromStore / 50)`).
     - **Creating Tensors**: Converting the data into tensors, which are like special arrays TensorFlow.js uses for math. For example:
       ```javascript
       const xs = tf.tensor2d(features); // Features tensor (8 customers x 6 features)
       const ys = tf.tensor2d(labels, [labels.length, 1]); // Labels tensor (8 customers x 1 score)
       ```

#### 2. **Building the Model**
   - TensorFlow.js creates a neural network, which is like a brain that learns patterns. The code defines it as:
     ```javascript
     const model = tf.sequential();
     model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 16, activation: 'relu', inputShape: [6] }));
     model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 8, activation: 'relu' }));
     model.add(tf.layers.dense({ units: 1, activation: 'sigmoid' }));
     ```
   - **What’s Happening**:
     - **Sequential Model**: A stack of layers where data flows from one to the next.
     - **Layers**: Three layers process the data:
       - **First Layer**: Takes 6 inputs (the features: age, total purchases, adjusted frequency, etc.), processes them with 16 "neurons" (math units), and uses a ReLU function to focus on positive patterns.
       - **Second Layer**: Refines the patterns with 8 neurons, also using ReLU.
       - **Third Layer**: Outputs 1 number (the target score, 0–1) using a sigmoid function to ensure the output is between 0 and 1.
     - **Input Shape**: `[6]` means the model expects 6 features per customer.

#### 3. **Compiling the Model**
   - The model is set up with rules for learning:
     ```javascript
     model.compile({
         optimizer: 'adam',
         loss: 'meanSquaredError',
         metrics: ['accuracy']
     });
     ```
   - **Optimizer (adam)**: A method to adjust the model’s math to make better predictions, like tweaking a recipe to improve the taste.
   - **Loss (meanSquaredError)**: Measures how wrong the model’s predictions are compared to the synthetic target scores. It tries to minimize this error.
   - **Metrics (accuracy)**: Tracks how well the model performs (though less relevant here since it’s a regression task, not classification).

#### 4. **Training the Model**
   - The model learns by looking at the customer data and synthetic scores:
     ```javascript
     await model.fit(xs, ys, { epochs: 50, batchSize: 8, verbose: 0 });
     ```
   - **What’s Happening**:
     - **Epochs (50)**: The model sees the data 50 times to learn patterns.
     - **Batch Size (8)**: It processes all 8 customers at once (since the dataset is small).
     - **xs and ys**: The features (xs) and synthetic scores (ys) are fed to the model. The synthetic scores are calculated as:
       ```javascript
       const score = (totalPurchases / max) * 0.25 + (adjustedFrequency / max) * 0.25 +
                     (avgPurchase / max) * 0.2 + (income / max) * 0.15 +
                     purchaseType * 0.1 + (1 - distanceFromStore / max) * 0.05;
       ```
     - TensorFlow.js adjusts the model’s internal weights (like tuning a radio) to make its predictions match these scores as closely as possible.

#### 5. **Making Predictions**
   - For the ranked customers:
     - The trained model predicts scores for all customers:
       ```javascript
       const predictions = model.predict(xs);
       const scores = await predictions.array();
       ```
     - These scores are used to sort customers and display them in the table with ranks.
   - For a new customer (via the form):
     - The form inputs (e.g., age: 30, total purchases: 2000) are normalized and adjusted (frequency reduced by distance).
     - They’re converted to a tensor and passed to the model:
       ```javascript
       const inputTensor = tf.tensor2d([inputFeatures]);
       const prediction = model.predict(inputTensor);
       const score = (await prediction.array())[0][0];
       ```
     - The score (e.g., 0.7532) is shown as a percentage (75.32%) with an explanation of each feature’s contribution.

#### 6. **Displaying Results**
   - **Ranked Customers**: The scores are used to sort customers and display them in a table with their details, score, and rank.
   - **New Customer**: The form prediction shows the score and an explanation, e.g.:
     ```
     Predicted Target Score for John Doe: 75.32%
     Explanation of Score:
     - Total Purchases ($2000.00): Contributes 7.14%...
     - Purchase Frequency (10 per year, adjusted to 7.00): Contributes 8.75%...
     ```

#### 7. **Memory Management**
   - TensorFlow.js creates tensors (data containers) that use memory. The code cleans them up to avoid memory leaks:
     ```javascript
     xs.dispose();
     ys.dispose();
     predictions.dispose();
     ```

### How TensorFlow.js Works (General Mechanics)

TensorFlow.js is a JavaScript version of TensorFlow, a popular machine learning framework. Here’s how it works under the hood, in simple terms:

1. **Tensors**:
   - Tensors are like spreadsheets of numbers (e.g., a 2D tensor is a table). They store data like customer features or model outputs.
   - TensorFlow.js does math (like matrix multiplication) on tensors using the browser’s GPU or CPU for speed.

2. **Neural Network**:
   - A neural network is a series of layers, each with "neurons" that perform calculations. Each neuron takes inputs, multiplies them by weights (learned numbers), adds a bias, and applies an activation function (like ReLU or sigmoid) to produce an output.
   - In the example, the network learns how features (e.g., high income, frequent purchases) relate to the target score.

3. **Training Process**:
   - **Forward Pass**: The model takes input features, processes them through layers, and predicts a score.
   - **Loss Calculation**: It compares the predicted score to the target score (synthetic in this case) using the loss function (mean squared error).
   - **Backpropagation**: The optimizer (adam) adjusts the weights to reduce the loss, making future predictions better.
   - This repeats for 50 epochs, improving the model each time.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Once trained, the model takes new data, runs it through the layers, and outputs a score. The sigmoid function ensures the score is 0–1, ideal for probabilities.

5. **Browser-Based**:
   - TensorFlow.js runs in the browser, using WebGL for fast math on the GPU. This makes it lightweight and server-free, unlike traditional TensorFlow (Python-based).

### Specifics in the Example
- **Features**: Six normalized features (age, total purchases, adjusted frequency, average purchase, income, purchase type).
- **Distance Adjustment**: `purchaseFrequency` is reduced by `distanceFromStore` (e.g., 10 purchases at 15 miles becomes `10 * (1 - 15/50) = 7`).
- **Model Output**: A single score (0–1) representing purchase likelihood.
- **Explanation**: For new customers, the code shows how each feature contributes to the score, based on the synthetic formula, making it user-friendly.

### Why TensorFlow.js?
- **Browser-Based**: No need for a server; runs directly in the HTML page.
- **Interactive**: Users can input data via the form and see results instantly.
- **Lightweight**: The small dataset and simple model work well in the browser.

### Potential Improvements
- **Real Labels**: Replace synthetic scores with real data (e.g., actual purchase outcomes) for better accuracy.
- **More Features**: Add data like customer loyalty or website visits, updating the model’s `inputShape`.
- **Complex Model**: Add more layers or neurons for larger datasets, though this model is sufficient for the small dataset.
- **Validation**: Add form input checks (e.g., max distance of 50 miles) to prevent errors.

### How to Use It
- **Run**: Save the HTML, open it in a browser, and the ranked table loads automatically.
- **Test**: Enter new customer data in the form (e.g., age: 30, total purchases: 2000, frequency: 10, etc.), click "Predict," and see the score with an explanation.
- **Modify**: Update `salesData` or the model (e.g., add features) and reload to retrain.

TensorFlow.js makes the machine learning process seamless in the browser, enabling the model to learn from customer data, predict scores, and provide actionable insights for targeting customers.
